# Book Search Engine


## Description
This streamlined application makes it easy for users to search for book titles and save them to their collection. By using the Google Books API and back-end queries and mutations through GraphQL, a user can search for just about any book via title or author. They are then presented with relevant search results that allow them to view each book's title and author, as well as a description of the book and a link to the book on Google Books. If the user is logged in to their account, they can also save the books to their collection to view later.
